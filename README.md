# StarcraftRM-Botty-The-Shit-Bot
This is a ocr program that controls a starcraft remastered client in Windowed mode to act like the classic bots

# Requirements
sikulixide-2.0.5
https://launchpad.net/sikuli/sikulix/2.0.5/+download/sikulixide-2.0.5.jar  
JDK 11.0.12+

# Setup
The program is fairly easy to use and isn't anywhere near a finished product.
I would highly suggest only running this in eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.    

1. Open and run starcraft Remastered the lastest version. Put this into the windowed mod with borders. No promises this will actually work as I am not sure if they change dimensions on other clients. I am sure I will go about making a better method for this later where it can accustom all shapes and sizes.
2. Run the program.
3. Enjoy!

# Notes
Do keep in mind this will take full control of the device it is on and will likely need to be ran on a seperate device to make it worth while.
There is no anti spam features built into this program as of the release of the initial release.
